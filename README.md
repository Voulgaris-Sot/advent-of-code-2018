# Advent of Code 2018

These are my partial solutions for the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) in Python. Most of the solutions are straightforward and pure bruteforce, with a few exceptions. I have not tested with other inputs and some solutions may fail to generalize. Still have to finish this year.
